Towers of Hanoi game for GA-SEI Project 1

### Project status for instructors:

    I have only put basic pseudocode, as most of my time has been spent reviewing concepts I'm not confident in such as flexbox etc. I feel like I am behind the other students on the timeline, but I'm confident in my progress. I also need to put some extra time into older homeworks. Such is life for bootcamp students. Staying organized has helped a lot, but as I've found IRL outside of CS, time management is my biggest enemy.
