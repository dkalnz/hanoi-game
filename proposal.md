## User Stories

AAU, I want to be able to have an interactive game that is styled, because games are supposed to be fun.
AAU, I want to be able to interact with my mouse, because as much fun as I had typing upside-down calculator words, it's not a game.
AAU, I want visual indication of where I am within a single move, such as picking up, holding, and placing pieces
AAU who has never played before, I want to be challenged, because a puzzle game isn't a game if it's nothing more than an interactive demo.
AAU, I'd like to see how many moves I've made, so that in the next playthrough I can beat my best
AAU, I'd like to see instructions for the game, so that I know what a clear goal is
AAU, I want to be able to view additional information about the history of the game, as the ancient basic puzzle structure intrigues me
AAU, I'd like basic functionality within the window, such as to restart
AAU, I'd like some accessibility such as high-contrast images, larger, simpler fonts etc

### MVP Goals

MVP is simple: 3 rods, _minimum_ 3 discs but preferably 7 for actual challenge (the amount of coding and logic between the two shouldn't differ greatly), interactive UI with a start dialog with basic instructions, win dialog, reset button, and move counter, with a colored UI, and at least a couple of fancy pants CSS implementations. This is the absolute _minimum_ viable product. Most of what I hope I get to spend time on is listed below.

### Stretch Goals

#### (Relatively attainable CSS and JS deeper-dive)

- Multiple levels/stages with varying difficulty
- Display user's 3 recent scores/moves per game whether reset or won
- Light mode/dark mode theme
- Other visual effects such as shrink-y or invert-y clickables such as buttons in UI

### Super Stretch Goals

#### (These either implement highly advanced CSS or external libraries, both of which I'd only attempt if I somehow have a surplus of time)

- Drag and drop functionality
- Smooth animations (super rabbit hole in and of itself)
- Other UI 'icing' such as shaking elements when a move is illegal
